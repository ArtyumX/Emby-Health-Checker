# Emby-Health-Checker
Start Emby if detected as not running
Story
--
Currently having a weird issue that makes Emby crash everytime, so I made a simple bash script that will automatically start Emby once detected as not running. This script might help people facing the same issue.
Usage
--
* wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArtyumX/Emby-Health-Checker/master/emby-health.sh
* chmod +x emby-health.sh
* ./emby-health.sh &
